# Data Exploration Project Using T-SQL

This project involves a detailed data exploration using T-SQL, focusing on a database of medical prescriptions. The implementation includes creating and using the database, defining primary keys, establishing relationships between tables, and performing various queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Features

- **Database Creation and Management**: Set up a database for managing medical prescriptions.
- **Primary Key and Foreign Key Constraints**: Defined primary keys and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Exploration Queries**: Implemented multiple queries to analyze the prescription data and extract valuable insights.

## Database Design

The database consists of the following tables:

- **Drugs**: Stores information about drugs, including descriptions and chemical substances.
- **Medical_Practice**: Stores information about medical practices.
- **Prescriptions**: Stores details of prescriptions, including quantities, items, and costs.

## Queries Implemented

1. **Tablets or Capsules**: Retrieves details of all drugs in the form of tablets or capsules.
2. **Total Quantity of Prescriptions**: Returns the total quantity for each prescription, rounded to the nearest integer.
3. **Distinct Chemical Substances**: Returns a list of distinct chemical substances in the Drugs table.
4. **Prescriptions by BNF Chapter**: Returns the number of prescriptions for each BNF chapter, along with the average, minimum, and maximum prescription costs.
5. **Most Expensive Prescription by Practice**: Returns the most expensive prescription prescribed by each practice, only if it is more than Â£4000.
6. **Chemical Substances with High Prescriptions**: Returns the number of prescriptions and average cost for each chemical substance with more than 100 prescriptions.
7. **High Dosage Drugs in Specific Categories**: Returns details of all drugs above 100mg in specific BNF chapters.
8. **Medical Practices in Bolton with High Prescription Quantity**: Returns all medical practices in Bolton with a prescription quantity above 100.
9. **High Quantity Prescriptions**: Returns the total prescriptions for each BNF code and their corresponding total quantity, only for high volume prescriptions.
10. **Chemical Substances by Practice**: Returns the number of chemical substances associated with each practice name, sorted by frequency.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
    - Use the provided T-SQL script `Analysis of NHS Prescriptions.sql` to create the database and tables.
    - Run the script in your SQL Server Management Studio to set up the database schema and initial data.

## Usage

- Run the provided queries to explore the data and extract insights as described in the sections above.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of T-SQL for data exploration and analysis in a medical prescriptions database. The queries provided enable detailed insights into prescription patterns, costs, and drug information, helping to uncover valuable information from the data.
